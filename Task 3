1. Store project metadata like song keys, bpm, and date modified as Redis key values:
Initialize:
FLUSHALL

Add attributes to the hash metadata:
    HSET project:1:meta key "C"
    HSET project:1:meta bpm "120"
    HSET project:1:meta dateModified "02/05/2024"
    INCR("projectCount")
Get attribute:
    HGET project:1:meta key
Update attribute:
    HSET project:1:meta key "D"
Delete attribute:
    HDEL project:1:meta key

2. Cache custom notes for each project:
Initialize:
FLUSHALL

Create note associated with project:
    SET project:1:note:1 "this project sucks so bad"
    SET project:1:note:2 "the vocals are pretty good actually"
    SET project:2:note:1 "send mix to alan to fix drums"
Read:
    GET project:1:note:1 (Get custom note 1 for project 1)
Update: 
     SET project:1:note:1 "this project is so good"
Delete:
    DEL project:1:note:1

3. Cache exported track info like location, name, and date created:
Initialize:
FLUSHALL

Create export associated with project's attributes:
    HSET project:1:exportVersion:1 name "Here Comes the Sun"
    HSET project:1:exportVersion:1 location "/ableton/exports"
    HSET project:1:exportVersion:1 dateCreated "02/02/2022"
Read:
    HGET project:1:exportVersion:1 name
Update:
    HSET project:1:exportVersion:1 name "Here Comes the Moon"
Delete:
    DEL project:1:exportVersion:1 name

4. Cache search history of project names:
Initialize:
FLUSHALL

Get the list of most recent search history:
ZREVRANGE recentSearchHistory 0 -1

When user searches for a project called project1, save to sortedSet:
ZADD recentSearchHistory <timestamp> "project1"

When user searches for a project called song2054, save to sortedSet:
ZADD recentSearchHistory <timestamp> "song2054"

Delete search history:
DEL recentSearchHistory
